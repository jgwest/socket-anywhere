- At the moment I'm assuming that all nodes share all IRC rooms
- One channel per server

- At the moment I'm assuming all commands will have a *-response command as the only reply, in order to prevent context collisions.

removed: my-uuid() / myid()

(we don't need myid() technically, the remote node already knows this from the connection id. and for target uuid, we could register a shortcut)

(or i could just include a shortened uuid in connection response)

also, i don't think shortening uuids will work
