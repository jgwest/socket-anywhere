Uses for a file-based lock:

"The behavior of the file lock is platform-dependent. On some platforms, the file lock is advisory, which means that unless an application checks for a file lock, it will not be prevented from accessing the file. On other platforms, the file lock is mandatory, which means that a file lock prevents any application from accessing the file. "

The efficacy of a filelock based locking scheme is therefore not consistent across platforms.

Systems that do not support locking, including:
- FTP
- Amazon S3
- Simple file systems
