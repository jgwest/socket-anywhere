
Two close event types:


1. Local user calls close():

Three places one can call close():
- On the Inputstream
- On the Outputstream
- On the Socket itslef

Inputstream and outputstream close() methods call close() on socket
The socket may then inform them back.




2. Remote user calls close:

- Detected in WatchingForCloseThread, which cals FileSocketImpl.informRemoteClose()
- FileSocketImpl.informRemoteClose() will then inform the outputstream and inputstream
- output stream should close immediately
- input stream should close when it runs out of data to read 


Input stream will clean up the data it would read, 30 seconds after a close.
